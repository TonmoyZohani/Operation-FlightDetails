                are going to have 20 days long road trip and touch nine
                exceptionally exotic countries of Europe. There simply is no way
                not be awestruck by its scenic beauty and artistic diversity.
                What is great about Europe is their cultural diversity. People
                even speak different languages. Some of their most unique
                attractions are the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France; Colosseum in
                Rome, Italy; Parthenon in Athens, Greece; and the Leaning Tower
                of Pisa, Italy. They are also known for their epic cuisines;
                like most popular Italian cuisine, French desserts,
                Switzerlandâ€™s chocolate etc. We are definitely going to have a
                blast in Europe.
